// 1.What is the difference between var and let?

//Let can be reassigned, var can't. Let is used for block scope. var can be reassigned and redclared. var can be hoisted.

//2.What is the difference between var and const?
// You can reassign and redeclare with var whereas with const you cannot. const is in block scope and var can access a hoisted variable.

//3.What is the difference between let and const?
// Let can be reassigned where const cannot. Neither can be redeclared.

//4. What is hoisting?
//It’s the way that we explain how the JS compiler works. Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using ***var***, you can access the variable name and it’s undefined value before it is used later on.
//Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” they are defined in a codebase.
